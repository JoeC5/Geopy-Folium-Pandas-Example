# Geopy-Folium-Pandas-Example
This is a geo map example using geopy, folium, pandas, and python.


Visual representations, especially when data is combined with maps, provide significant advantages for storytelling, understanding spatial relationships (like a company's footprint), and identifying hidden patterns within data. This repository offers a practical demonstration of how to construct a map.

In this example. I wanted to build a map that showcases the firestations in my community as well as highlight a 2 mile radius around each station. 
The following tools were used:
1) Excel - spreadsheet hold the addresses for firestations in the area
2) GeoPy - used to quickly pull latitude and longitude coordinates 
3) Pandas - to convert the Excel data into a useable dataframe
4) Folium - used to build the map

The code (in the .ipynb file) hs notes with explanations for each section. One caveat - the code file unfortunately does not include the map - please look at the png file. 

Here are a few more examples of how and why you could this type of visualization:
1)	Include in a regional dashboard for sales monitoring and/or head count by regional office. 
2)	Fiscal planning – example – school district needs a new elementary school. This visual helps with understanding of new location sites relative to existing schools. 
3)	As a salesperson or marketer, you want to visualize the locations of your customer base as you are assessing your local, regional, national market penetration.
4)	You are in law enforcement, and you track crimes in your area. Visualizing crime locations via a map can help with how area patrols are scheduled or understanding trends in the area.
5)	You are a real estate agent or mortgage banker/broker and want to understand sales trends in your market. Mapping sales will help you understand these trends.
