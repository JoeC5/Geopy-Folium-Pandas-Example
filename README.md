# Geopy-Folium-Pandas-Example
This is a geo map example using geopy, folium, pandas, and python.


Visual representations, especially when data is combined with maps, provide significant advantages for storytelling, understanding spatial relationships (like a company's footprint), and identifying hidden patterns within data. This repository offers a practical demonstration of how to construct a map.

In this example. I wanted to build a map that showcases the firestations in my community as well as highlight a 2 mile radius around each station. 
The following tools were used:
Excel - spreadsheet hold the addresses for firestations in the area
GeoPy - used to quickly pull latitude and longitude coordinates 
Pandas - to convert the Excel data into a useable dataframe
Folium - used to build the map
